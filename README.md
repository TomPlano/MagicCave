Far out in the Sea of Fallen Stars, beyond the Pirate Isles, a new island has risen.
Thrust high above the waterline by a violent earthquake, it  was not long before
it was discovered by the Aglarond, venturing out onto the sea for trade and war.
Intrigued by the appearance of a new island, the high wizards of Aglarond sent
adventuring parties out to the island. Some returned, though many did not.
Those that did return told grand but conflicting tales of their time on the
island, with the only point of commonality being an unusual cave that stood
near the top of the newly formed cliffs. Each party told vastly different
accounts of the contents of the cave and each had the treasure to back up their
claims. It was finally determined that a more magical approach must be taken,
and a team of skilled wizards was dispatched, in the hopes that the secretes of
the cave would be made clear. It was to no avail however. All the was determined
was that the cave was indeed changing its contents periodically and the
mechanism was unknown. During this time treasure, monsters and even other
people were discovered within the cave, all of which had no idea of the
existence of a world outside their cave system, or of the countless other cave
systems that had been discovered in tandem to them. At the urging of the high
wizards, a commission was established on the island, both to protect the cave
and to collect a tax on those adventuring parties lucky enough to make it out
alive. It now stands open to anyone willing the take the challenge of
The Cave of Shards. Perhaps one day its secrets will be revealed.
