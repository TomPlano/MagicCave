## 1. How To
At this stage you should have comipled the code. To run the code simply type ./MagicCave.sh \<height> \<width> \<level> \<player_count>

The args work as follows: <br />
First arg \<height>: This arg represents the map with to be generated <br />
Second arg \<width>: This arg represents the map height to be generated <br />
Third arg \<level>: This arg represents the average player level in the party <br />
Fourth arg \<player_count>: This arg represents the amount of players in the party <br />

## 2. Outputs
All output files are stored in the same directory as the aplication. <br />
Map and legend will be output to a file called Adventure_log.txt. Any npcs or characters created will be found in a folder called pdf. 5E character sheets have been filled out with important data pertaining to generated characters. 

## 3. Recommended Run Style
It's recommeneded to take the map and divide it into 20x20 grids or whatever your prefered playmat size might be. Each grid section can be considered an area for the players to explore. When the player leaves the grid section then move them to the neighboring grid section. In cases where items or encounters end up in closed off sections of cave it's recommended for the GM to be creative in letting the players get to the object. Perhaps theres a door there or a small crack in the wall the players could break through. The map isn't static, the GM can make changes at will to further there own campaign or add a creative touch to this generated world.
